PROJECT: KANGAROO 🦘

I'm building an open-source app for the NVIDIA GTC Golden Ticket Developer Contest. The deadline is February 15, 2026. This needs to be impressive enough to win.

WHAT IS KANGAROO?

A web app where multiple AI agents debate your question in real-time and converge on a better answer than any single AI could give.

One-liner: "Ask a question. Watch AIs argue. Get a smarter answer."

The name "Kangaroo" because:
- Kangaroos box (agents "fight it out")
- Ideas bounce back and forth
- A group of kangaroos is called a "mob"
- Memorable and unique

THE CORE IDEA

When you ask one AI a question, you get one perspective. It might be wrong. It might miss things. It's overconfident.

Kangaroo spawns multiple AI agents with different perspectives. They debate each other, challenge assumptions, find flaws, and converge on a refined answer. Research proves this improves accuracy and reasoning.

The user watches this happen in real-time. That's the magic — seeing AI think together.

There will also be feature where user can select productivity so like they answer questions or have tasks or debate.

In debate mode the agents which for will be limit three debate in favor of idea against with modernator asks questions

HOW IT WORKS

User submits a question (text, or code for debugging)

System spawns 3 agents (each is the same Nemotron model but with different system prompts):

1. ADVOCATE
   - Argues the positive/optimistic side
   - Sees potential and opportunity
   - Makes the case FOR something

2. CRITIC  
   - Challenges assumptions
   - Finds flaws and risks
   - Plays devil's advocate
   - Asks "but what about..."

3. JUDGE
   - Synthesizes both perspectives
   - Finds the truth between positions
   - Delivers the final verdict
   - Balances nuance

Debate flow:
- Round 1: Advocate responds → Critic responds → Judge responds
- Round 2: Each agent sees Round 1, responds to each other's points
- Round 3 (optional): Further refinement if positions still diverging
- Final: Judge delivers verdict with reasoning from both sides

Each agent receives the full conversation history so they can directly reference and respond to each other.

TWO MODES

MODE 1: GENERAL QUESTIONS
- "Should I quit my job to start a startup?"
- "Is it worth getting a PhD in 2026?"
- "What's better,
