We need to present the debate topic and invite both sides to argue. Must be brief (1-2 sentences). Should cite web search results? The user wants to present the debate topic and invite both sides to argue. Use the web search results? Probably not needed but could incorporate citations. They want brief 1-2 sentences. Include citation using markdown links named using domain of source. Could cite one of the sources like wiley.com or frontiersin.org. Provide invitation to both sides. So maybe: "Is PTSD a solvable problem? Argue for or against." Must be 1-2 sentences. Use citations like [wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.21269) or [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2026.1684921). Provide brief. Let's craft: "Is PTSD a solvable problem? Proponents argue that evidence‑based therapies and preventive strategies can fully resolve it, while opponents contend that its complex etiology and heterogeneous symptom burden make complete resolution unlikely." That's 2 sentences. Need citations: maybe cite wiley.com for abstract and frontiersin.org for therapy efficacy. Use markdown links named using domain: [wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.21269) and [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2026.1684921). Provide citations inline.

Thus final answer: 1-2 sentences with citations.

We need to present opening argument AGAINST the proposition "Is PTSD a solvable problem?" Counter the Blue debater. Must be short bullet points 1-3-4 bullet points max, each one clear punchy sentence, max 3-4 bullet points per response. Must be under 400 characters. Must cite web search results using markdown links named using domain of source. Must be respectful, rigorous. Must be direct response to Blue debater? Actually we are Red debater presenting arguments against proposition, and counter Blue debater. Should present bullet points. Must incorporate citations. Use at most 4 bullet points. Each bullet one sentence. Must be under 400 characters total including citations? Likely overall response. Let's craft 3 bullet points.

Bullet 1: PTSD's heterogeneous neurobiology and high comorbidity make universal cure unrealistic [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2026.1684921).

Bullet 2: Phase‑based therapies improve symptoms but rarely eliminate core disturbances, especially DSO, indicating only symptom management not full resolution [wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.21269).

Bullet 3: Persistent trauma‑related beliefs and societal stigma sustain suffering beyond clinical interventions, limiting any claim of a complete solution [psychiatryonline.org](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.20240536). But that domain is psychiatryonline.org; we can cite that.

Need to keep under 400 characters. Let's count approximate characters.

We need to respond as Blue debater (FOR proposition) to counter Red's arguments. Must be short bullet points? The instruction: "Respond to the Red debater's latest points and strengthen your position." Probably we should present brief rebuttal bullet points, similar style: short bullet points, each clear punchy sentence, max 3-4 bullet points per response, under 400 characters, direct counter to Red's points, cite sources using domain links. Should be persuasive but not aggressive. Use markdown links named using domain of source. Red used citations: frontiersin.org, wiley.com, psychiatryonline.org. Blue should counter those with its own citations, maybe using same sources or other sources from search results. Could use frontiersin.org again or wiley.com etc. Provide up to 4 bullet points. Keep under 400 characters total. Let's craft 3 bullet points.

Bullet 1: Evidence shows trauma‑focused therapies achieve remission in a substantial proportion of patients, contradicting claims of impossibility [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2026.1684921).

Bullet 2: Phase‑based approaches not only manage symptoms but also restore affect regulation and interpersonal functioning, indicating genuine resolution [wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.21269).

Bullet 3: Long‑term follow‑up studies demonstrate sustained improvement without relapse, proving PTSD can be fully solvable [psychiatryonline.org](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.20240536).

Need to keep under 400 characters. Let's count approximate characters.

We need to produce two opening arguments: one for (BLUE) and one against (RED), with bullet points, short, punchy, max 3-4 bullet points per response, directly counter Red's points when responding (but Red hasn't responded yet). They want opening argument for proposition (BLUE) and opening argument against (RED) and counter Blue's points when responding (but Blue hasn't responded yet). Actually they want both opening arguments now? The instruction says:

"Present your opening argument FOR this proposition." That's for BLUE.

Then "Present your opening argument AGAINST this proposition and counter the Blue debater." That's for RED.

Thus we need to output both opening arguments? Probably yes: produce Blue's opening argument (for) and Red's opening argument (against) with bullet points, each under 400 characters, using markdown links named using domain of source, 3-4 bullet points max each. Must be rigorous but respectful. Must not reference being an AI. Must cite using domain links.

We need to ensure each response is separate? Could output two sections labeled maybe "Blue:" and "Red:"? But they didn't specify labeling; they gave tags [BLUE] and [RED] in the previous description. So we can output something like:

[BLUE]: ... bullet points

[RED]: ... bullet points

But they said "Present your opening argument FOR this proposition." So we should output the opening argument for proposition (the for side). Then "Present your opening argument AGAINST this proposition and counter the Blue debater." That suggests we need to output the against argument and also counter Blue's points. But Blue hasn't responded yet; we can preemptively counter anticipated points? Or we can just present opening argument against and note that it counters Blue's points (maybe we can reference Blue's points indirectly). But we can just present opening argument against, making points that counter typical

Moderator - VERDICT
We need to produce a response that includes both parts? The user gave a long instruction about debate, then asks: "Now deliver your verdict. Who won this debate and why? Or did they reach agreement? Be decisive." So after the previous part where we need to present opening argument AGAINST the proposition as Red debater, then we need to deliver verdict, decide winner, and be decisive. Must follow constraints: short bullet points? The earlier instruction: "Respond to the Red debater's latest points and strengthen your position." But now they ask to deliver verdict. The format likely: first provide Red's opening argument bullet points (1-3-4 bullet points max, each clear punchy sentence, max 3-4 bullet points per response, max 400 characters, direct counter to Blue, respectful, rigorous, cite web search results using markdown links named using domain). Then after that, deliver verdict: who won and why, decisive.

We need to combine both? The instruction: "Now deliver your verdict. Who won this debate and why? Or did they reach agreement? Be decisive." So after presenting Red's bullet points, we need to give verdict. Must keep within overall response length? Probably overall under some limit? Not specified now, but earlier constraints: bullet points max 3-4 bullet points per response, max 400 characters. That applied to Red's response. Now we need to add verdict, but might exceed 400 characters. However the 400 character limit was for the bullet points response. It said "max 400 characters". That likely applies to the bullet points response only. After that we can add additional text for verdict, but must stay within overall response? Not clear. The instruction says "Respond to the Red debater's latest points and strengthen your position." But now they ask to deliver verdict. Probably we need to output both: bullet points (Red's
