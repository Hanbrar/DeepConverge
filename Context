CONTEXT: NVIDIA GTC GOLDEN TICKET CONTEST

I'm entering a contest to win a Golden Ticket to NVIDIA GTC 2026.

CONTEST REQUIREMENTS (from Bryan Catanzaro, VP of Deep Learning Research at NVIDIA):
- Build an awesome open source project
- Must use NVIDIA technology
- Must use NVIDIA Nemotron models
- Post about it on X, tag @Baxate, use #NvidiaGTC
- Deadline: February 15, 2026
- Winner announced: February 25, 2026

PRIZES:
- GTC 2026 Conference Pass with VIP keynote seating
- NVIDIA DGX Spark (personal AI supercomputer)
- Happy hour at NVIDIA HQ
- Training Lab Pass
- Merch

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Bryan will see hundreds of submissions. Most will be basic chatbots or simple wrappers. I need something that:
1. Stands out visually (great demo in a tweet)
2. Shows real engineering (not just an API wrapper)
3. Uses Nemotron in an interesting way
4. Is actually useful
5. Is fully open source
